This project is about making a mobile-phone tracking system.
It is a simple application to keep track of mobile-phones registered in a network, 
their location, and status.
It provides actions to add mobile-phone, and change all information concerning a previously registered mobile.
It implements tree to find shortest route to traverse while calls are made.

It extensively uses OOP concepts of Java, and Tree algorithms for search and route operations.

It was made as a part of the course Data Structures & Algorithms (COL106), IIT Delhi.
